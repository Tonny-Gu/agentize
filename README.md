# AI-powered SDK for Software Development

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize.git
```
2. Use this repository to create an SDK for your project.
```
make agentize \
   AGENTIZE_PROJECT_NAME="your_project_name" \
   AGENTIZE_PROJECT_PATH="/path/to/your/project" \
   AGENTIZE_PROJECT_LANG="c" \
   AGENTIZE_MODE="init"
```

This will create an initial SDK structure in the specified project path.
For more details of the variables and options available, refer to our
[usage document](./docs/options.md).

## Core Phylosophy

1. Plan first, code later: Use AI to generate a detailed plan before writing any code.
   - Plan is put on Github Issues for tracking.
2. Build [skills](https://agentskills.io/).
   - Skills are modular reusable, formal, and lightweighted flow definitions.
   - This is something like C-style declaration and implementation separation.
     - `/commands` are declarations and interfaces for users to invoke skills.
     - `/skills` are implementations of the skills.
3. Bootstrapping via self-improvment: We have `.claude` linked to our `claude` rules
   directory. We use these rules to develop these rules further.
   - Top-down design: Start with a high-level view of the development flow.
   - Bottom-up implementation: Implement each aspect of the flow from bottom, and finally
     integrate them together.

### Workflow:

`/ultra-planner` command flow (multi-agent debate-based planning):
```mermaid

    A[User provides requirements] --> B[Bold-proposer agent]
    A --> C[Proposal-critique agent]
    A --> D[Proposal-reducer agent]
    B[Bold-proposer: Research SOTA & propose innovation] --> E[Combine reports]
    C[Critique: Validate assumptions & feasibility] --> E
    D[Reducer: Simplify following 'less is more'] --> E
    E[Combined 3-perspective report] --> F[External consensus review]
    F[Codex/Opus: Synthesize consensus plan] --> G[User approves/rejects plan]
    G -->|Approved| H[Create Github Issue]
    G -->|Refine| A
    G -->|Abandoned| Z(End)
    H[Open a dev issue via open-issue skill] --> I[Code implementation]

`/issue2impl` command flow:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Github Issue created] --> B[Fork new branch from main]
    B --> C[Step 0: Update documentation]
    C --> D[Step 1: Create/update test cases]
    D --> E[Step 2: towards-next-milestone skill]
    E -->|more than 800 lines w/o finishing| F[Create milestone document]
    F --> G[User starts next session]
    G --> E
    E -->|finish all tests| H[Step 4: Code reviewer reviews quality]
    H --> I[Step 5: Create pull request]
    I --> J[User reviews and merges]

    style G fill:#ffcccc
    style J fill:#ffcccc
    style B fill:#ccddff

    style E fill:#ccddff

    style H fill:#ccddff
    style I fill:#ccddff
```

**Legend**
- Red boxes: user interventions, including providing development
requirements, approving/rejecting results (both intermediate and final),
and starting new development sessions.
- Blue boxes: automated steps performed by AI agents/skills/commands.
