# AI-powered SDK for Software Development

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize.git
```
2. Use this repository to create an SDK for your project.
```
make agentize \
   AGENTIZE_PROJECT_NAME="your_project_name" \
   AGENTIZE_PROJECT_PATH="/path/to/your/project" \
   AGENTIZE_PROJECT_LANG="c" \
   AGENTIZE_MODE="init"
```

This will create an initial SDK structure in the specified project path.
For more details of the variables and options available, refer to our
[usage document](./docs/options.md).

## Core Phylosophy

1. Plan first, code later: Use AI to generate a detailed plan before writing any code.
   - Plan is put on Github Issues for tracking.
2. Build [skills](https://agentskills.io/), do not build agents.
   - Skills are modular reusable, formal, and lightweighted flow definitions.
3. Bootstrapping via self-improvment: We have `.claude` linked to our `claude` rules
   directory. We use these rules to develop these rules further.
   - Top-down design: Start with a high-level view of the development flow.
   - Bottom-up implementation: Implement each aspect of the flow from bottom, and finally
     integrate them together.

### Workflow:

`/plan-an-issue` command flow:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User provides requirements] --> B[Novel-proposer agent]
    B[Novel-proposer: Break down into uncommon plans] --> D[Synthesis agent]
    B --> C[Critique agent]
    C[Critique: Review feasibility] --> D
    D[3rd-party reviewer: Synthesize final plan via consensus & conflicts] --> E[User approves/rejects plan]
    E -->|Approved| F[Create Github Issue]
    E -->|Refined| A
    E -->|Abandoned| Z[End]
    F[Open a dev issue] --> G[Code implementation]

`/issue2impl` command flow:
```mermaid

    A[Github Issue created] --> B[Fork new branch from main]
    B --> C[Step 0: Update documentation]
    C --> D[Step 1: Create/update test cases]

    E -->|more than 800 lines w/o finishing| F[Create milestone document]
    F --> G[User starts next session]
    G --> E
    E -->|finish all tests| H[Step 4: Code reviewer reviews quality]
    H --> I[Step 5: Create pull request]
    I --> J[User reviews and merges]

    style I fill:#ccddff
```

**Legend**
- Red boxes: user interventions, including providing development
requirements, approving/rejecting results (both intermediate and final),
and starting new development sessions.
- Blue boxes: automated steps performed by AI agents/skills/commands.

Refer to [our tutorial](./docs/user-tutorial.md) for a detailed walkthrough of the workflow,
as well as [our developer guide](./docs/contrib.md) to understand the internal implementations.
