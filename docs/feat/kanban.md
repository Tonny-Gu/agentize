# Kanban Viewboard Management

TODO: Document viewboard management using GitHub Project V2.

## Overview

This document describes how Agentize integrates with GitHub Projects V2 to provide kanban-style viewboard management.

- Each plan created by `core/ultra-planner.md` will be represented as an entry on the viewboard.
- Each PR executed from plans by `core/issue-to-impl.md` will be represented as an entry on the viewboard.
