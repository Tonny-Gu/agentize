"""Unified workflow definitions for handsoff mode.

This module centralizes workflow detection, issue extraction, and continuation
prompts for all supported handsoff workflows. Adding a new workflow requires
editing only this file.

Supported workflows:
- /ultra-planner: Multi-agent debate-based planning
- /issue-to-impl: Complete development cycle from issue to PR
- /plan-to-issue: Create GitHub [plan] issues from user-provided plans
- /setup-viewboard: GitHub Projects v2 board setup
- /sync-master: Sync local main/master with upstream

The ultimate goal of this workflow is to create a comprehensive plan and post it on GitHub Issue. Have you delivered this?
1. If not, please continue! Try to be as hands-off as possible, avoid asking user design decision questions, and choose the option you recommend most.
2. If you have already delivered the plan, manually stop further continuations.
3. If you do not know what to do next, or you reached the max continuations limit without delivering the plan,
   look at the current branch name to see what issue you are working on. Then stop manually
   and leave a comment on the GitHub Issue for human collaborators to take over.
   This comment shall include:
    - What you have done so far
    - What is blocking you from moving forward
    - What kind of help you need from human collaborators
    - The session ID: {session_id} so that human can `claude -r {session_id}` for a human intervention.
4. To stop further continuations, run:
   jq '.state = "done"' {fname} > {fname}.tmp && mv {fname}.tmp {fname}
5. When creating issues or PRs, use `--body-file` instead of `--body`, as body content with "--something" will be misinterpreted as flags.''',

    ISSUE_TO_IMPL: '''This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode, it is currently {count}/{max_count} continuations.
The ultimate goal of this workflow is to deliver a PR on GitHub that implements the corresponding issue. Did you have this delivered?
1. If you have completed a milestone but still have more to do, please continue on the next milestone!
1.5. If you are working on documentation updates (Step 5):
   - Review the "Documentation Planning" section in the issue for diff specifications
   - Apply any markdown diff previews provided in the plan
   - Create a dedicated [docs] commit before proceeding to tests
2. If you have every coding task done, start the following steps to prepare for PR:
   2.0 Rebase the branch with upstream or origin (priority: upstream/main > upstream/master > origin/main > origin/master).
   2.1 Run the full test suite following the project's test conventions (see CLAUDE.md).
   2.2 Use the code-quality-reviewer agent to review the code quality.
   2.3 If the code review raises concerns, fix the issues and return to 2.1.
   2.4 If the code review is satisfactory, proceed to open the PR.
3. Prepare and create the PR. Do not ask user "Should I create the PR?" - just go ahead and create it!
   - Creating the PR should use the `/open-pr` skill with appropriate titles.
4. If the PR is successfully created, manually stop further continuations.
5. If you do not know what to do next, or you reached the max continuations limit without delivering the PR,
   manually stop further continuations and look at the current branch name to see what issue you are working on.

   - Parse and format the plan content appropriately
   - Create the issue with proper labels and formatting
   - Use `--body-file` instead of `--body` to avoid flag parsing issues

    SYNC_MASTER: '''This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode, it is currently {count}/{max_count} continuations.
The ultimate goal of this workflow is to sync the local main/master branch with upstream and force-push the PR branch.

1. Check if the rebase has completed successfully:
   - Run `git status` to verify the working tree state
   - If rebase conflicts are detected, resolve them and run `git rebase --continue`
   - If rebase was aborted, re-run the sync-master workflow from the beginning
2. After successful rebase, verify the PR number is available: {pr_no}
   - If PR number is 'unknown', check the current branch name for the PR association
3. Force-push the rebased branch to update the PR:
   - Run `git push -f` to push the rebased changes
   - Verify the push succeeded without errors
4. After successful push, manually stop further continuations.
5. If you encounter unresolvable conflicts or errors:
   - Stop manually and inform the user what happened
   - Include what you have done so far
   - Include what is blocking you
   - Include the session ID: {session_id} so that human can `claude -r {session_id}` for intervention.
